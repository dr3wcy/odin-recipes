        <figcaption>Lasagna is an Italian baked pasta dish made by layering wide,
         flat pasta sheets with fillings such as ragù (meat and tomato sauce), béchamel (white sauce),
         cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan, and vegetables, then baking it until bubbly and browned. 
         The dish can refer to both the layered baked casserole and the specific type of wide, flat pasta used to make it.</figcaption>
